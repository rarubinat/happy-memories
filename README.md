## 🎮 About the Game

Happy Memories is my first video game developed using Unity. It is a 2D platformer that I designed and built entirely as part of my learning experience in game development.

*Happy Memories* is a 2D platformer game where the player controls **Yari**, a girl who wakes up in a dark and distorted world. Her objective is to recover positive memories scattered across the levels in order to escape this place and restore her inner light.

The game reflects a metaphorical journey through depression and personal recovery. As players collect "light orbs," the game's visuals evolve from dark and oppressive to colorful and hopeful.
